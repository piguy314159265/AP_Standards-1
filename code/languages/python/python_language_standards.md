# AP Python Language Coding Standards

In terms of style standards, prioritize in the following way:
1. Use style of the surrounding code
2. Use style of this document
3. Use [style of PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Favor readability over style matching

## Nomenclature
### Hungarian Notation
If using hungarian notation or a variant thereof, use with an underscore to separate from the variable:
```
# OK
my_name_sc
ExceptionName_se

# BAD
my_nameSC
scMyName
```
